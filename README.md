# Federated Learning with CNN on MNIST

## Overview
This project implements a Federated Learning approach using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset. The goal is to simulate decentralized training where multiple clients contribute to model training without sharing raw data.

## Features
- Implementation of a CNN for image classification.
- Federated learning simulation across multiple clients.
- Model training, aggregation, and evaluation.
- Visualization of validation loss per client.
